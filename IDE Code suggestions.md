## Getting comment suggestions

GitHub Copilot can suggest comments for your code, by analyzing the code you write and generating comments that describe what the code does. For Copilot Free users, comment suggestions count towards your monthly Copilot Chat usage, not your code suggestions usage.

Comment suggestions are available in the following languages:

- C#
- C++
