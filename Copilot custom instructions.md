## [About customizing GitHub Copilot Chat responses](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/prompting/response-customization#about-customizing-github-copilot-chat-responses)

GitHub Copilot can provide chat responses that are tailored to the way your team works, the tools you use, or the specifics of your project, if you provide it with enough context to do so. Instead of repeatedly adding this contextual detail to your chat questions, you can create files in your repository that automatically add this information for you.
