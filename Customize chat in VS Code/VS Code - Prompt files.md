Prompt files are Markdown files that define reusable prompts for common development tasks like generating code, performing code reviews, or scaffolding project components. They are standalone prompts that you can run directly in chat, enabling the creation of a library of standardized development workflows.

They can include task-specific guidelines or reference custom instructions to ensure consistent execution. Unlike custom instructions that apply to all requests, prompt files are triggered on-demand for specific tasks.

Note

Prompt files are currently experimental and may change in future releases.
