Custom instructions enable you to define common guidelines and rules that automatically influence how AI generates code and handles other development tasks. Instead of manually including context in every chat prompt, specify custom instructions in a Markdown file to ensure consistent AI responses that align with your coding practices and project requirements.

You can configure custom instructions to apply automatically to all chat requests or to specific files only. Alternatively, you can manually attach custom instructions to a specific chat prompt.
