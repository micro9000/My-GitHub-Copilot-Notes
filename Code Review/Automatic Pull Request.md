By default, Copilot will only review a pull request if it's assigned to the pull request in the same way you would assign a human reviewer. However:

- Individual users on the Copilot Pro or Copilot Pro+ plan can configure Copilot to automatically review all pull requests they create.
- Repository owners can configure Copilot to automatically review all pull requests in the repository that are created by people with access to Copilot.
- Organization owners can configure Copilot to automatically review all pull requests in some or all of the repositories in the organization where the pull request is created by a Copilot user.
