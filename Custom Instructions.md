## Wide custom instructions

 You specify repository-wide custom instructions in a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file in your repository.

### [Example](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/request-a-code-review/use-code-review?tool=vscode#example-1)

This example of a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file contains three instructions that will be applied to all Copilot code reviews in the repository.

```text
When performing a code review, respond in Spanish.

When performing a code review, apply the checks in the `/security/security-checklist.md` file.

When performing a code review, focus on readability and avoid nested ternary operators.
